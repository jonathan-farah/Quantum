This Python script utilizes Qiskit's VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver) to compute the minimum eigenvalue of a 
sample Hamiltonian using a variational ansatz (EfficientSU2) and a classical optimizer (COBYLA). 
The VQE is executed on an IBM Quantum backend using the Qiskit Runtime Service, 
providing an efficient way to run quantum algorithms on real quantum hardware.

Key Components
Qiskit Runtime Service: Manages the connection to IBM's quantum backend.
VQE (Variational Quantum Eigensolver): A hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to find the ground state energy of a given Hamiltonian.
COBYLA: The classical optimizer used to minimize the parameterized quantum state to achieve the lowest eigenvalue.
EfficientSU2: A variational quantum circuit (ansatz) used to approximate the ground state of the Hamiltonian.
Qiskit Runtime Estimator: Used to estimate expectation values during the VQE process.

EfficientSU2: A library of pre-built quantum circuits for variational algorithms. EfficientSU2 is a parameterized ansatz, 
widely used in quantum algorithms like VQE.
VQE: A variational algorithm that uses a parameterized quantum circuit and classical optimization to estimate the 
lowest eigenvalue of a Hamiltonian.
COBYLA: A classical optimizer that minimizes the energy of the quantum system using a constrained optimization approach.

 ensuring that the job runs on real quantum hardware.

 with Session(service=service, backend=backend) as session:
    ### test hamiltonian
    hamiltonian = sample_hamiltonian()

    # Define a sample variational ansatz
    ansatz = EfficientSU2(hamiltonian.num_qubits)

    estimator = RuntimeEstimator(session=session)

Session: The session is used to manage the lifecycle of communication with the quantum backend. 
All the jobs related to this session are tied to the specific IBM Quantum device.
sample_hamiltonian: This is a user-defined function that generates a test Hamiltonian (represented by Pauli operators) 
to run the VQE algorithm.
EfficientSU2: The ansatz (parameterized quantum circuit) that encodes the variational quantum state. 
It is designed for the number of qubits required by the Hamiltonian.
